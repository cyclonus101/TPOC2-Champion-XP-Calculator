# TPOC2 Champion XP Calculator Patch 6.7 Update
Install AHK to start running it  
To start click the Green Code button in the top right corner and click download  
Extract the folder to where you want it to be  
Start the .ahk to start it  
  
Otherwise, download the exe from the releases section, but your computer anti-virus will definitely complain about it.  
  
Usage:  
  
At the bottom left-hand corner there is a white box 
Where you write down your current champ XP      
Then the amount of adventures to level up is automatically generated in text boxes at the top    
This is based on the target level drop down menu which you can change by pressing on it and selecting a level 
  
I've removed the Legend Level XP calculator part because riot releases new events with massive amounts of LLXP that makes it worthless.
