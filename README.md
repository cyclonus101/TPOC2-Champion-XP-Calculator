# TPOC2 Champion & Legend XP Calculator Patch 6.7 Update
To start click the Green Code button in the top right corner and click download  
Extract folder to where you want  
You can use the .exe to start, but your antivirus might complain about it  
If you have AutoHotKey installed, you can use the .ahk to start it instead  
  
Usage:  
  
At the bottom left-hand corner there is a white box 
Where you write down your current champ XP      
Then the amount of adventures to level up is automatically generated in text boxes at the top    
This is based on the target level drop down menu which you can change by pressing on it and selecting a level 
 
 
I've removed the Legend Level XP calculator part because riot releases new events with massive amounts of LLXP
